  A Dye-sensitised solar cell(DSSC) is a type of thin film soalr cell. DSSCs work in a different way ot silicon based (p-n jubnction) solar cells.

    DSSCs create electricity through the photoelectric effect. This begins with the absorption of an incident photon, by the dye, which acts as the photosensitizer of the DSSC. This promotes the photosensitizer from the ground state (~HOMO) to the excited state (~LUMO). Subsequently, the excited dye emits an electron, which is injected into the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor, usually titanium dioxide (TiO2), leaving the dye oxidized. The electrons are then transported between TiO2 nanoparticles to the anode. From the anode, the electrons flow to the cathode via an external circuit. At the cathode, the electrons enter an electrolyte solution containing a redox couple, e.g. I3-/I-. The cathode is coated in a thin film of a catalyst for the reduction of the redox couple (in this case I3- to I-), which is typically platinum, but can also be carbon based. The iodide moves through the solution to the TiO2 and oxidized dye. The latter is then reduced by the electrons released from the oxidation of I-, which returns to I3-.
